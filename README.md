# People Analytics Object Detection using NCS2 and Raspberry Pi 


## Requirements

ensure the openvino toolkit is installed, as is python <3.6. 
For MOVIDIUS flag need an NCS2 attached to the Pi or the PC

## May Need to set up the system variables to set the path variables

cd ~\IntelSWTools\openvino\bin (or whereever openvino is installed on whichever device)
setupvars.bat 

## Run 

cd Users\jack\Documents\openvino\final_project
py object_detection_demo_ssd_async.py -m person-detection-retail-0013.xml -i CAM -d MOVIDIUS

py people_object_detection_draw_on_frame.py -m person-detection-retail-0013.xml -i CAM -d MOVIDIUS

py people_object_detection_people_trackingc.py -m person-detection-retail-0013.xml -i CAM -d MOVIDIUS

-i controls the input, there are sample vidoes included -i retail1.mp3 and -d CPU is an optional also to control the device

-m is the model, in this case an object detecttion model that came with the open vino toolkit 

## Files 

**people_object_detection_draw_on_frames.py** - this file draws the data being inferred from the model on some frames which are in turn displayed to the user. 

**people_object_detection_people_tracking.py -** this file records in a PSQL database the number of people in the frame every 100 frames.

It also records overcrowding alerts (an earlier iteration of the project) where the number of people exceeds a threshold in a remote PSQ database.

**object_detection_demo_ssd_async.py** - this is the original file provided with the openvino toolkit which was adapted

## Screenshot 

this is what 'draw on frames' file returns.
